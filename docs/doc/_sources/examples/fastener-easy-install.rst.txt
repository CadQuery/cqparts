Evaluation / Selection / Application
------------------------------------

.. tip::

    *Evaluation*, *selection*, and *application* are fundamental concepts for
    using fasteners as more than just floating objects, read
    :ref:`parts_fasteners_using` to learn more.

**Evaluator**

We don't need anything special for the fastener evaluation; we can use the
standard :class:`VectorEvaluator <cqparts.fasteners.utils.VectorEvaluator>`.

::

    TODO: code for evaluator (if any)

**Selection**

To illustrate the selection mechanic, we'll register 2 types of *wood screw*
for this fastener:

#. short shaft, and short thread
#. longer shaft, and a longer thread

::

    TODO: code for selector

**Application**

The evaluation should result in 2
:class:`Effect <cqparts.fasteners.utils.evaluator.Effect>` instances:

#. longways through the middle of the vertical chipboard being fastened
#. perpendicular to the adjoining

::

    TODO: code for applicator
