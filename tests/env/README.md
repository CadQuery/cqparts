# Test Environments

Each of the sub-folders in this directory has a buildable environment to test.

At this time [2018-02] I'm just working with docker containers with _ubuntu_
environments.


## Windows

Ideally I'd also have a _windows_ testing environment as well, however I'm
just a little fuzzy on how to run a licensed windows box to a similar degree
of independence as the docker containers used to test _linux_ environments.

For example, do I need 2 windows licenses to test under python2 and python3...
there's no way I'm spending that money.
