Welcome to ``cqparts``' Documentation!
==========================================


What is ``cqparts``?
----------------------

``cqparts`` is CAD for Python programmers, short for ":mod:`cadquery` parts".

Using ``cqparts`` you can wrap geometry made with :mod:`cadquery` to build
complex and deeply parametric models.


What can I do with ``cqparts``?
------------------------------------

You can build solid geometry in the same way you write an application; your
geometry can be *built* on a headless system, automated, and revision controlled
to your hearts content.

You can export your models ready to be processed for 3d printing, or milling,
or to be displayed / imported to another 3d app.


What you should know
--------------------------

As this library is an extension of :mod:`cadquery`, it's highly recommended you
have an understanding of what :mod:`cadquery` is, and how to use it first.
