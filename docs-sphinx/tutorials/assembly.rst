Design Considerations
---------------------

**Motor**

If you're making a motor, consider that others may want to:

* change output shaft *diameter*, &/or *length*
* change mounting points may be in a different position, or scale.
* change output shaft *coupling* may be changed.
* align output shaft with another.
