Publishing Components
====================================

If you'd like to publish your *components* to be used by others, you can
release your own library of *components* in a few different ways.


Add to Existing Library
----------------------------

*Components* can potentially be added to any existing library.

You're welcome to create a pull request with your model for any of the
libraries in the
`cqparts github repository <https://github.com/fragmuffin/cqparts/tree/master/src>`_.

Any change pushed to these libraries will prompt a version increment and your
additions will be added to the changelog with you as the author.

Please `raise an issue <https://github.com/fragmuffin/cqparts/issues/new>`_
if you're considering doing this, and we can discuss the location and design of
the components you wish to add.


Create a New Library
---------------------------

You may also start your own library.

When doing so it's highly recommended that you copy the
`cqparts_template library <https://github.com/fragmuffin/cqparts/tree/master/src/cqparts_template>`_
and follow the instructions in the ``README.md`` to make the relevant changes.

Publishing a New Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When publishing you can choose to add it to the current list of ``cqparts``
libraries hosted in the
`cqparts github repository <https://github.com/fragmuffin/cqparts/tree/master/src>`_.

Or you can publish the library from your own repository, independent of ``cqparts``.
