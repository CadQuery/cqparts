# `cqparts_TODO` Components

TODO: brief description of your library, include an image

## Components

TODO: List components by group, give a user an idea of the breadth of the
library's content

## Utilities

TODO: List anything that isn't strictly a `Component` that may be used as part
of this library.

## Example

TODO: A brief example of your library, include fully qualified code and an image
of the resulting model
For more detailed documentation, consider using sphinx, that way cross-linking
of components in documentation is easy.
