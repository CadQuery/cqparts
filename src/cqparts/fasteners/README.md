# Fastener Types

## Screws

In practical terms, screws fasten a workpiece to an anchor with
* a full-sized hole (the screw thread's outer diameter) in the workpiece(s)
* a pilot hole in the anchor

When applied, the screw itself will tap the anchor part.

Pilot hole diameter is depenedent on the screw's thread, and the material the
anchor is comprised of.

## Bolts

A bolt fixes all parts between the head, and the opposing thread (often a nut)
